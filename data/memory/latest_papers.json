Numerous disciplines, such as epidemiology, which is the study of the transmission and management of infectious diseases like Covid-19, can benefit from the study of graph theory. Like, the first case of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) was reported in November of 2019; by the third week of April, 1,116,643 verified positive cases had been reported, with around 59,158 fatalities. All the meditational structures are symmetric, if we label to change the labels of graphs in either way the graph becomes symmetric and will be no change to it. So, there are many graph theoretical parameters to study the symmetric meditational structures, like metric and edge metric dimension. A notion known as edge metric dimension or edge metric basis states that with a chosen subset from the vertex set, known as the edge resolving set, the whole edge set of a structure uniquely recognised. This idea of vertices resolvability allows for the distinct identification of COVID antiviral medication structures and aids in the research of the structure's structural characteristics.

Chemical graphs, with edges and vertices representing bonds and atoms, respectively, are used in chemical graph theory to represent molecular structures. The investigation of various pharmacological substances and complex molecular structures is made easier by the application of chemical graph theory. The resolvability parameter, a measure derived from graph theory, is a fundamental idea in this discipline. It requires every vertex in a structure to have a unique representation through chosen vertices, which are referred to as a metric basis, locating set, or resolving set in various scientific contexts. A key factor in describing the structural characteristics of chemical graphs is the metric dimension, which is the smallest number of vertices in the resolving set. In this work, we looked at the vertex and edge metric dimensions of the drug structures for the treatment of breast cancer, including Toremifene, Ribociclib, Tucatinib, Olaparib, and Abemaciclib and also we estimated the dimensions of the vertex and edge metrics while treating various drug structures as chemical graphs.

This suggests that the topographical knowledge of the environments (i.e., cognitive map) to find the right route to a goal is represented in the PCG, and the patients lack such knowledge. However, theoretical backgrounds in neuronal levels for these symptoms in primates are unclear. Recent behavioral studies suggest that human spatial knowledge is constructed based on a labeled graph that consists of topological connections (edges) between places (nodes), where local metric information, such as distances between nodes (edge weights) and angles between edges (node labels), are incorporated. We hypothesize that the population neural activity in the PCG may represent such knowledge based on a labeled graph to encode routes in both 3D environments and 2D maps. Since no previous data are available to test the hypothesis, we recorded PCG neuronal activity from a monkey during performance of virtual navigation and map drawing-like tasks. The results indicated that most PCG neurons responded differentially to spatial parameters of the environments, including the place, head direction, and reward delivery at specific reward areas. The labeled graph-based analyses of the data suggest that the population activity of the PCG neurons represents the distance traveled, locations, movement direction, and navigation routes in the 3D and 2D virtual environments. These results support the hypothesis and provide a neuronal basis for the labeled graph-based representation of a familiar environment, consistent with PCG functions inferred from the human clinicopathological studies.' url='https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ae153721b12c77fe94fdb1c01aad2188429d1f81' relevance_score=0.5 impact_score=1.0",

To address this issue, we put forward the definition of confidence level (ConfLevel) on the basis of XAI and verify its effectiveness as the metric of selecting the base learner.

To fill this research gap, we are devoted to developing a dynamic load balance -aware CEE offloading strategy.

The algorithm incorporated regional boundary constraints in the pre-processing stage to focus on preserving the boundary features of the model, and incorporated visual constraints, such as the vertex importance, edge length, and texture, in the calculation of the edge folding cost to construct a new error metric model. The simplification order was changed by redefining the edge folding cost, and a trade-off between compression rate and retention rate was made by using half-edge folding to maximise the retention of the visual features of the building. The experimental results showed that the algorithm could effectively reduce the number of elements drawn by the system and achieve a high level of detail information retention in the visual feature region of the model with a good visual representation.' url='https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7edc9c1ab0da199c274c24b51cfd6dacd2172033' relevance_score=0.35 impact_score=4.0",

The basis for (quantitative) structure-property and structure-activity predictions, a central area of cheminformatics, is laid by the computable properties of graphs. The physical characteristics of molecules are thus reflected in these graphs, which can subsequently be reduced to graph-theoretical indices or descriptors. The resolving set Z, which distinguish every pair of distinct vertices in a connected simple graph, is one of the most well-studied distance-based graph descriptors.

Differing from exploited the Gaussian distribution to get analytical form of distance measure, we propose a novel oriented regression loss, Wasserstein Distance(EWD) loss, to alleviate the square-like problem.

The Artistic and Historical Research focuses on a specific part, an element or a type of surveyed buildings in the selected time period. Its results can be further developed and interpreted in a wider cultural context of the respective rural region. In this way, it is possible to describe the cultural and social environment of the given rural region and external influences which have guided its future development in the given time period. The objective of metric survey documentation is to provide a reliable spatial and temporal framework for future analyses.The article presents practical experience in using metric survey documentation of rural buildings. Its outputs can serve for e.g. drawings, 3D models, photographs, orthophotos, thematic maps and others.</jats:p>' url='https://doi.org/10.14311/cej.2018.01.0005' relevance_score=0.3 impact_score=0.0",

Scientists from all over the world are actively developing medical or anti-virus medications, which are safe and effective for COVID-19. The anti-viral drugs of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have proved to be an efficient inhibitory effect by preventing the binding of spike covid protein. The determination of a pharmaceutical structure using a topological index allows researchers to have a better understanding of the physiological as well as bio-organic properties of drugs. The goal of this study is to employ molecular graph theory to determine some graph-theoretic parameters related to the molecular graph of CQ and HCQ. In this paper, we present some resolvability parameters such as metric dimension (MD), edge metric dimension (EMD), fault-tolerant metric dimension (FTMD), and fault-tolerant edge metric dimension (FTEMD) of CQ and HCQ. We prove that these resolvability parameters for CQ and HCQ are bounded and constant.' url='https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ae5be424b85590e86ba41737e1af388740e457b' relevance_score=0.28 impact_score=4.0",
