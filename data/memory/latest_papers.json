The analysis of different networks, such as the Benes network, butterfly network, hex-derived network and biswapped network, using TIs is one of the modern research fields. The storage and transfer of data carrying certain information has always remained a modern world problem. The optoelectronic technology used in optical transpose interconnection systems (OTIS) is efficient in outcome over an electrical system due to the minimum power consumption and broad bandwidth. By combining the use of wireless and electrical technologies, OTIS has developed into a valuable network and boosted the efficiency of contemporary optoelectronic computers. A special type of OTIS is the biswapped network over the path graph Pn , denoted by B(Pn) . In this article, a maximal twin-preserving subgraph of a biswapped network over the path graph Pn is constructed. Moreover, the biswapped network B(Pn) and its constructed subgraph are compared through ev-degree- and ve-degree-dependent TIs. In addition to this, to analyse the complexity of B(Pn) and MT(B(Pn)) through information functional-based entropies, we define ve-degree- and ev-degree-based information functionals and compute formulae for ve-degree- and ev-degree-based entropies. The analytical formulae, tables and graphical trends are used to describe a comparison between the TIs and entropies of B(Pn) and MT(B(Pn)) .

This spatial topography is typically defined with reference to an influential network parcellation scheme that designated the DN as one of seven large-scale networks (Yeo et al., 2011). However, the precise functional organization of the DN is still under debate, with studies arguing for varying subnetwork configurations and the inclusion of subcortical regions. In this vein, the so-called limbic network\u2014defined as a distinct large-scale network comprising the bilateral temporal poles, ventral anterior temporal lobes, and orbitofrontal cortex\u2014is of particular interest. A large multi-modal and multi-species literature on the anatomical, functional, and cognitive properties of these regions suggests a close relationship to the DN. Notably, these regions have poor signal quality with conventional fMRI acquisition, likely obscuring their network affiliation in most studies. Here, we leverage a multi-echo fMRI dataset with high temporal signal-to-noise and whole-brain coverage, including orbitofrontal and anterior temporal regions, to examine the large-scale network resting-state functional connectivity of these regions and assess their associations with the DN. Consistent with our hypotheses, our results support the inclusion of the majority of the orbitofrontal and anterior temporal cortex as part of the DN and reveal significant heterogeneity in their functional connectivity. We observed that left-lateralized regions within the temporal poles and ventral anterior temporal lobes, as well as medial orbitofrontal regions, exhibited the greatest resting-state functional connectivity with the DN, with heterogeneity across DN subnetworks. Overall, our findings suggest that, rather than being a functionally distinct network, the orbitofrontal and anterior temporal regions comprise part of a larger, extended default network.' url='https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c1cd3c25fc9cf0e83dbf37f4e6ff35a86b20891' relevance_score=0.6000000000000001 impact_score=17.0",

Towards personalized generative services, a collaborative cloud-edge methodology is promising, as it facilitates the effective orchestration of heterogeneous distributed communication and computing resources. In this article, we put forward NetGPT to capably synergize appropriate LLMs at the edge and the cloud based on their computing capacity. In addition, edge LLMs could efficiently leverage location-based information for personalized prompt completion, thus benefiting the interaction with the cloud LLM. In particular, we present the feasibility of NetGPT by leveraging low-rank adaptation-based fine-tuning of open-source LLMs (i.e., GPT-2-base model and LLaMA model), and conduct comprehensive numerical comparisons with alternative cloudedge collaboration or cloud-only techniques, so as to demonstrate the superiority of NetGPT. Subsequently, we highlight the essential changes required for an artificial intelligence (AI)-native network architecture towards NetGPT, with emphasis on deeper integration of communications and computing resources and careful calibration of logical AI workflows. Furthermore, we demonstrate several benefits of NetGPT, which come as by-products, as the edge LLMs\u2019 capability to predict trends and infer intents promises a unified solution for intelligent network management & orchestration.

The UAV is a promising technology that provides aerial base stations (ABSs) to assist the edge network in enhancing the ground network performance, extending network coverage, and offloading computationally intensive tasks from UEs or IoT devices. In this paper, we deploy a clustered multi-UAV to provide computing task offloading and resource allocation services to IoT devices.

Their capability of learning complex patterns and behaviors make them a suitable solution for differentiating between normal traffic and network attacks. However, a drawback of neural networks is the amount of resources needed to train them. Many network gateways and routers devices, which could potentially host an NIDS, simply do not have the memory or processing power to train and sometimes even execute such models. More importantly, the existing neural network solutions are trained in a supervised manner. Meaning that an expert must label the network traffic and update the model manually from time to time. \\nIn this paper, we present Kitsune: a plug and play NIDS which can learn to detect attacks on the local network, without supervision, and in an efficient online manner. Kitsune's core algorithm (KitNET) uses an ensemble of neural networks called autoencoders to collectively differentiate between normal and abnormal traffic patterns. KitNET is supported by a feature extraction framework which efficiently tracks the patterns of every network channel. Our evaluations show that Kitsune can detect various attacks with a performance comparable to offline anomaly detectors, even on a Raspberry PI.
