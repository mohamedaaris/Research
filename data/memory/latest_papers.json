The size of a smallest determining set for $G$ is called its determining number, $Det(G)$. A graph $G$ is said to be $d$-distinguishable if there is a coloring of the vertices with $d$ colors so that only the trivial automorphism preserves the color classes. The smallest such $d$ is the distinguishing number, $Dist(G)$. If $Dist(G) = 2$, the cost of 2-distinguishing, $\u03c1(G)$, is the size of a smallest color class over all 2-distinguishing colorings of $G$. The Mycielskian, $\u03bc(G)$, of a graph $G$ is constructed by adding a shadow master vertex $w$, and for each vertex $v_i$ of $G$ adding a shadow vertex $u_i$ with edges so that the neighborhood of $u_i$ in $\u03bc(G)$ is the same as the neighborhood of $v_i$ in $G$ with the addition of $w$.

A graph is twin-free if it has no pair of vertices with the same set of neighbors.

Often OC patients enter an initial remission following chemotherapeutic or surgical interventions; however, ~75% of patients experience chemotherapy-resistant OC recurrence. This study aims to investigate the impact of aging on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and chemosensitivity of various subtypes of ovarian cancer (OC) to therapies targeting slower proliferating OC cells, which often lie dormant in patients and lead to disease recurrence. We have found slower proliferating OC cells exhibited a statistically significant higher sensitivity to the chemotherapy treatment ibrutinib compared to faster-proliferating cells in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs) in vitro. Cisplatin-resistant HGSOC cell lines displayed increased chemosensitivity to ibrutinib compared with the cisplatin-sensitive HGSOC cell lines. In clear cell ovarian carcinomas (CCOCs), we did not see dose-dependent chemosensitivity to duvelisib or ibrutinib, but there was an increased sensitivity when compared to the fast-proliferating HGSOC control. CCOC cell lines JHOC5 and TOV21-G showed increased responses to higher doses of UCN-01, but OVISE, the slowest proliferating CCOC did not.

I further modified the environment and trajectory through various expansions, addition of features, and data smoothing to ensure a more stable sequence of input frames into the SLAM architecture. I then examined the efficiency of visual ORB-SLAM3 by inputting images of resolution 256\u00d7144 and 512\u00d7288 at 30 frames per second (FPS), while also adjusting the feature threshold - the maximum number of feature points that ORB-SLAM3 tracks per frame.

The subsequent runs under these variables reveal that higher resolution images lead to considerably better tracking, with an optimal feature threshold ranging between 3000~12000 feature points per frame.

By incorporating experimental data and a stochastic systems population model, several biological mechanisms and observations are further understood. A populations model is utilized to account for enzymatic expression level variation from 75% to 125% of their base values. When generating the population model, uniform distributions are assumed when simulating maximum velocity values, which correspond to enzyme expression levels. We investigate this assumption and show that it is reasonably insensitive; that is, changes in the distributions used to generate these values do not significantly change the results of the model. We also use the model to simulate the effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), one of the first treatments discovered for depression. We then use similar methods to simulate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most common antidepressant used today.

The cellular effects of progesterone are mediated by the nuclear progesterone receptor (PGR). Progesterone resistance, a decreased cellular response to progesterone,is implicated in a wide range of pathologies including endometriosis, preterm birth, and endometrial cancer. Up to 10% of females within reproductive age are impacted by endometriosis, and no cure is available. This study hypothesizes that misregulation of PGR by upstream regulators is a potential cause of progesterone resistance. However, much remains unknown about the regulation of PGR expression, including the location of enhancers and the identity of transcriptional regulators that control PGR expression. In this study, candidate regulatory elements of PGR were identified by integrative analysis of genomic data, and their function was tested using the CRISPR activation system, with PGR mRNA levels as the readout. Using these methods, two PGR enhancers located at the PGR 3\u2019 untranslated region and 200 kbs upstream of the PGR transcription start site were identified. These enhancers permitted the identification of candidate upstream regulators of PGR expression in the uterus, including GATA2, ARID1A, KLF9, and ESR1. Activation of ESR1 increased PGR mRNA levels in the presence of estradiol in cultured uterine cells. Through the discovery of PGR regulators, we can improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms of progesterone resistance. Ultimately, these regulators could be evaluated in cases of progesterone resistance and targeted in the development of therapies.</jats:p>' url='https://doi.org/10.55894/dv3.11' relevance_score=0.08 impact_score=0.0",

In 1967 two mathematicians, Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker, developed a mathematical theorem to the effect that particles do not have well-defined property values at a given time. A logical consequence of this is that there can be no well-defined hidden variables responsible for the outcomes of mysterious quantum behaviors. The theorem is thus fatal to the many deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics that assume hidden variables, including pilot wave mechanics, a quantum theory developed by Louis de Broglie and David Bohm a few decades prior to the formulation of the Kochen-Specker Theorem. The purpose of this essay is to evaluate the legitimacy of the logical basis of Kochen\u2019s and Specker\u2019s argument considering its severe implications. It is concluded that Kochen and Specker do not provide sufficient evidence that deterministic theories must fail, due to their misinterpretation of the axioms on which hidden variable theories rely. This paper also finds that pilot wave mechanics is mathematically successful while remaining consistent with the deterministic understanding of broader physics and deserving of more serious consideration as a quantum theory. Above all it is emphasized that the nonsensicality of absolute randomness and indeterminism should be acknowledged, and theorems purporting to prove their existence should be critically examined, for such a discovery would undermine the legitimacy of logic itself.</jats:p>' url='https://doi.org/10.55894/dv2.23' relevance_score=0.08 impact_score=0.0",

Thus, they prefer low status to conform to the external social pressure of other group members\u2019 expectations. Yet, internal factors such as self-esteem and personality traits may also shape individuals\u2019 preferred status by buffering the effects of external factors. To examine these hypotheses, two studies were conducted, in which the participants\u2019 self-perceived value and self-esteem were manipulated. The results from these studies were consistent with previous studies, showing that participants with higher SPV preferred and expected higher status than participants with lower SPV. Moreover, individuals\u2019 personality traits predicted the status they preferred and expected: more extroverted participants preferred and expected higher status than less extroverted participants, while participants with higher levels of neuroticism preferred and expected lower status than participants with lower levels of neuroticism. Participants with higher self-esteem were also more likely to prefer and expect higher status. Lastly, low self-esteem was associated with lower preferred status for participants with low SPV, but not high SPV. Because self-esteem is correlated with individuals\u2019 socioeconomic status (SES), this study further highlights the need to address the self-esteem gap between individuals in high and low SES to prevent pre-established social hierarchies from perpetuating.</jats:p>' url='https://doi.org/10.55894/dv2.24' relevance_score=0.08 impact_score=0.0",

Aim: The aim of this paper is to understand how masculinity and attitudes towards sex impact male contraceptive usage and how preference could inform strategies to ultimately improve uptake and usage. Increased contraceptive use could have profound public health and financial impact given the potential to prevent unwanted pregnancies and promote equitable family planning. Method: 103 male participants aged 18+ completed a self-report electronic survey assessing masculine norm endorsement, attitudes towards sexuality and likelihood-of-usage of three novel male contraceptives; namely Nestorone, MENT and RISUG. Masculine norm endorsement was measured using an adapted version of Parent and Moradi\u2019s Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory-46, and the Sexual Opinion Survey was used to assess positive-negative attitudes toward sex. Participants were also asked which of the three contraceptive they would be most likely to use and why Results: The data showed no significant correlation between either masculine norm endorsement or attitudes towards sexuality and likelihood-of-usage for novel male contraceptives. However, the sample did show a hierarchy of preference; Nesterone was the most preferred method, followed by RISUG, and finally the sample indicated a significant aversion to MENT. For each contraceptive, common themes for preference were easily identifiable. Those who preferred Nesterone cited \u2018Non-invasiveness\u2019 and \u2018Ease of use\u2019 as their reasoning. Those who preferred RISUG indicated the \u2018Convenience\u2019 and \u2018Longevity\u2019 of the method as the reason for preference. Those who preferred MENT, cited \u2018Non-daily use\u2019 and \u2018Less invasive [than RISUG]\u2019. Those who preferred MENT seemed to fit a niche between RISUG and Nesterone: while they do not wish to partake in the daily application of Nesterone, they are also opposed to the procedure involved with RISUG. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the sample showed preference with regards to the novel forms of male contraceptives. The reasons indicated by the sample regarding their preference pointed to specific driving factors, motivated by what the individual values. Namely: ease of use, longevity, and surgical procedure avoidance. Furthermore, this suggests the need for multiple methods of male contraceptives to satisfy a broader range of individuals. Thus, this study yields important data that may help to inform future contraceptive design and research to meet the needs and preferences of young adult males.</jats:p>' url='https://doi.org/10.55894/dv1.11' relevance_score=0.04 impact_score=0.0",
